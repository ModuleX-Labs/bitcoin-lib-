# ModuleX - Bitcoin Protocol

![ModuleX Logo](logo.png)

## Project Background & Technical Blueprint

### 💡 Project Overview

ModuleX is a social experiment by Bitcoin fundamentalists, a fission module of Bitcoin's original consensus layer. It is the architecture of belief that Bitcoin needs!

As the first consensus propagation layer (Meme Layer Protocol) built on the Bitcoin network, the ModuleX protocol aims to solve key issues in the current Bitcoin ecosystem: lack of native consensus propagation mechanisms, value symbols for retail investors, and truly replicable viral models for "community structure replication". Through the innovative "propagation-lock-staking" trinity mechanism, ModuleX transforms consensus propagation itself into productivity, making every user a propagation factor (Consensus Carrier).

The project is built on the Casey Runes protocol, running natively on Bitcoin Layer1 without relying on multi-chain compatibility. Through core technical components such as Propagation Engine, Consensus Mining, and Burn Mining, ModuleX has established a complete social credit protocol and propagation incentive mechanism. The globally deployable Propagation Hub network allows every city to become an independent "fire domain", achieving self-organizing replication and fission expansion of communities.

ModuleX is not just a token project, but a protocol-level social consensus mining experiment aimed at proving the core concept that "consensus propagation itself is productivity". Through online and offline promotion strategies, plans are to establish 20-30 city "fire domain nodes" in South Korea, Japan, China, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam and other places, promoting the global fission of Bitcoin faith, making consensus no longer hidden in code, but burning in human communities.

- **🏷️ Project Name**: ModuleX  
- **🎯 Project Positioning**: The first consensus propagation layer (Meme Layer Protocol) built on the Bitcoin network  
- **🌟 Core Vision**: Let consensus no longer hide in code, but burn in human communities

**The core technical concepts aim to recognize and build:**

- Bitcoin cannot only carry finance, it must become the narrative ontology
- Bitcoin is the trunk, Runes are tools, but the ModuleX protocol is the fission mental model
- Retail investors are not investors, but propagation factors (Consensus Carrier)

## I. Project Background & Mission

### 💡 1.1 Cosmic Origin Narrative: Cultural and Technical Fission of Bitcoin Ecosystem

After the explosion of Runestone and Runes protocol in 2023, the Bitcoin ecosystem was injected with "cultural assets" for the first time. However, existing assets on Bitcoin still lack three key elements:

1. **Native consensus propagation mechanism** — Lack of spontaneous community propagation momentum
2. **Value symbols for retail investors** — Lack of value carriers that ordinary people can understand
3. **Truly replicable viral models for "community structure replication"** — Lack of scalable community building mechanisms

The birth of the ModuleX protocol is to solve these three fundamental problems.

### 💡 1.2 Founding Team Background

The ModuleX protocol was initiated by three Bitcoin fundamentalists:

- **Max R. Hedlund** (USA/Sweden)
  - Former Open Ordex developer
  - Bitcoin tech geek, focused on Layer1 protocol optimization
- **Thomé Vega** (Indian-American geek)
  - Former Blockstream community architecture consultant
  - Expert in Bitcoin ecosystem design
- **Aya.K** (Former SBF research team member)
  - Expert in Bitcoin visual culture
  - Focused on cryptocurrency user experience design

### 💡 1.3 Core Philosophy

> "Narrative ≠ Story. It's architecture of belief. And Bitcoin needs it."

ModuleX believes that all current BTC ecosystem projects are too "rational" and lack "fire", therefore establishing the ModuleX protocol with the vision: "Let consensus no longer hide in code, but burn in human communities."

> "ModuleX is not just a token, it's a protocol-level experiment in social-consensus mining on the Bitcoin network."

### 💡 1.4 Community Formation & Target Vision

Max R. Hedlund, Thomé Vega, and Aya.K, three Bitcoin fundamentalist tech leaders, created and launched the ModuleX protocol, but as tech geeks, they did not promote it. However, this concept received positive responses from communities in China, Japan, South Korea, Europe, South Asia, and other regions, who began to spontaneously promote it, thus forming a matrix multi-modal community.

In China, we have a large group of Bitcoin fundamentalist believers, and we also believe this will be the next hotspot. For this reason, a group of communities that have successfully cooperated multiple times, adhering to Bitcoin fundamentalism and relying on the beliefs of three tech thinkers, plan to actively promote ecological interaction in community form and establish consensus on great ideas.

## II. Core Logic & Protocol Components

### 💡 2.1 Protocol Technical Architecture

#### 2.1.1 Foundation Protocol Layer

- **Casey Runes Protocol**: Tokens run natively on BTC Layer1, not relying on multi-chain compatibility
- **Bitcoin Layer1 Native**: All functions are built directly on the Bitcoin main chain
- **Runes Core Layer**: All token issuance is based on the new Runes protocol on Bitcoin Layer1

#### 2.1.2 Consensus Propagation Layer

- **Bull Propagation Engine**: Social credit protocol that tracks user propagation behavior, engagement, and staking activity
- **Burn Mining Concept**: No electricity mining required, but generates credits and incentives through "propagation-lock-staking" behavior
- **Fire Domain Structure**: Globally deployable "Propagation Hub" (propagation nodes), replicating and spreading community fire

### 💡 2.2 Logic System (Meme-Layer Vocabulary)

#### 2.2.1 Core Concepts

- **Narrative Mining**: Propagating narratives itself is productivity
- **Propagation Hub**: City-level propagation hub, replicating the Bull model
- **Burn Mining**: Activate network consensus through social fission, staking, and interaction
- **Meme Amplifier**: Leaderboard + propagation credit system forms community-driven structure

#### 2.2.2 Technical DNA

ModuleX is a protocol with technical DNA: **BTC + Runes + Consensus Propagation Layer**.

It is the first protocol-level experiment built on Bitcoin Layer1 Narrative, with "consensus-driven propagation" as its core.
